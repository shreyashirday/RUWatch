Do or Donate is a Fitness app that incentivizes exercising by wagering donations to charities. On the android app, the user logs in through Facebook and submits a wager, a number of calories, and the time frame the user wants to achieve his goal in. If the user fails to burn that many calories in their selected timeframe, their wager is donated to a charity of their choice. Using android wear, the app calculates how many calories you burn during an exercise session and subtracts it from the total calorie count. To store user data we used Microsoft Azure.
