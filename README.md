RUWatch a.k.a. Do Or Donate
=======
Do or Donate is a Fitness app that incentivizes exercising by wagering donations to charities. On the android app, the user logs in through Facebook and submits a wager, a number of steps, and the time frame the user wants to achieve his goal in. If the user fails to reach their step goal in that selected timeframe, their wager is donated to a charity. Using android wear, the app calculates how many steps you have taken. To store user data we used Microsoft Azure.
